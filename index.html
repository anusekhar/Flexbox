        In this unconventional talk are used quite commonly in HTML, often in places that might not be obvious or apparent. The key is to use them as semantically as possible and to leverage them where they best fit.
        <h6>About Chris</h6>
        Notice how the first speaker element, for Chris Mills, includes the class attribute value of speaker, which vertically separates it from the speaker element for myself, Shay Howe. The last speaker element, again for myself, doesn’t include a class attribute
        value of speaker in order to keep it a proper distance from the element.
